Bean vs Component:-

Bean is used at method level and we need to create the object, return it in the method
Bean is used for the classes of Other libraries like creating RestTemplate object( we use bean)
Bean creates instance variable with the method name provided.

Component is used at Class level
Component is used for Classes created by us in our micro service.
Component instance is created by spring container by scanning the class path
Component instance variable is created by camel casing of the class name.


Ways to create object in Spring Container:-
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebmi2hfvWE)
1. using ApplicationContext object and use api to get the object with class name or string
2. using @Lookup for the method below we will get MyObj1 by calling myobj1() method.
        class A {
       @Lookup
       public MyObj1 myobj1() {

                        }

            }
3. using javax.inject.Provider of Java SDK
 public Provider<MyObj1> myObj1Provider
 myObj1Provider.get() to get the object
4. use ObjectFactory from Spring framework
 public ObjectFactory<MyObj1> myObj1Provider
 myObj1Provider.getObject() to get the object
